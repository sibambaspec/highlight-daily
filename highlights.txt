> The term ‘polyp’ is a clinical description of any protrusion of 
the mucosa


> Metaplastic or hyperplastic polyps are common and are gener-
ally considered benign


> Sessile serrated lesions 
and hyperplastic polyps ≥10 mm in diameter are associated 
with KRAS/BRAF mutation that may lead to methylation of 
tumour-suppressing genes, dysplasia and malignancy along 
what is termed the ‘serrated pathway’


> Adenomatous polyps are the most common polyps with 
malignant potential. The risk of malignancy is dependent on 
histology, morphology and size.


> Tubular adenomas have the 
lowest risk, with increasing risk as villous features predominate.


>  Failure of submucosal 
injection to elevate a polyp is suggestive of malignancy


> risk of 
malignant change increases with size, almost one-third of large 
(>3 cm) colonic adenomas w
